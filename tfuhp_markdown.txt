Theorists have been able to eloquantly describe traffic behavior by using deterministic models. For example, the deterministic _flow-density-speed_ relationship of $q = k * u$ where $u$ is assumed to be a constant, allowing  $q = k * u$ to be depicted as a  triangle, the "fundamental diagram." This model helps explain queuing at a bottleneck. It has drawbacks, like, depicts vehicles accelerating and decelerating instanteously.


Forecasts from the  $\alpha(t)$ and the exponential model of speed,  $u(t) = exp(-\lambda t)$, prove effective in modeling _traffic breakdown_.

Note that the vehicles reach a mile, 5280 feet, in less than 60 seconds. As can be seen, the vehicles are assumed to maintain the same speed before and after the merge. After the merge, the two vehicles are also shown to be very close together. The traffic density is doubled because the densities on each lane are assumed to be equal. In reality, this is a very unlikely situation. A type of merge could only happen  if vehicles were not traveling side-by-side, not traveling so close together, and not traveling at such a  high speed. Regardless, the animation is instructive.


Before discussing the examples, we will clearly disinguish difference between _animation_ and a _stochastic process._ The function   produces an _animation_ as shown in the $t-x$ trajectory. Two lanes of traffic merge into one line forcing the drivers to merge. 

        1. What is a bottleneck?
        
        2. What are the top speeds of vehicles 2 and 3 in passing vehicle 1?
        
        3. Are the drivers of these vehicles driving safely?
        
        4. Is this animation a reasonable description of reality?
        


The animation depicted below is an idealistic description of a _zipper_ merge. To achieve a zipper merge, all drivers must be highly disciplined. Not only must they maintain the same exact speed and most importantly, must be perfectly aligned when merging. A situation that analogous to closing a zipper.  When the two halves of a zipper are joined together, it becomes securely fastened together because the zipper teeth are precisely aligned on zipper tape. Zippers work well regardless of how fast or slow the  zipper  is fastened together. Roadway zipper merges can be observed in the field but only at low speed.  



## The State-of-the-Art of Traffic Engineering 

We will now take advantage of classical methods to build upon the approach developed for a ring road to explain traffic merging and breakdown observed at a bottleneck.

From above, it can be seen that data collection is vitally important. Observational data, collected with loop detectors, radar (fire-side radar readings at our location) and by other means, are  expensive to obtain and not always available at location of interest. Controlled experiments described in textbooks are neither contemplated nor performed in practice. Sugiyama etal. experiment and experiments are rare occurrences. Mathematical models  derived from classical theory, probability models,  thought experiments,  sound judgement and  simulation brought about advances in high-speed computer have the potential   for generating needed data and analyzing complex transportation networks. 

Theorists have been able to eloquantly describe traffic behavior by using deterministic models. These advances have been made in large part by ignoring the  volatility observed in the data. Over the course of time, these models have been subject to rigorous proof and scutiny. At the same time, there is the fear that important information about the complex nature of traffic behavior is lost by ignoring volatility. By building on the foundation offered by  deterministic  models with the aid of  high-speed computing, we attempt to simulate reality.  That includes mimicing human and vehicle dynamics behavior as realistically as possible. 



## Animation and Stochastic Processes {.tabset}


A most effective tool for understanding various characteristics of traffic performance is the use of time-space $t-x$ trajectories. See the animation entitled _Vehicles entering a Bottleneck_ below. It shows the trajectories of three vehicles. The trajectories were derived from the time-varying acceleration $\alpha(t)$ model exclusively. 

The reader cannot help notice that this vignette contains several panels including an input panel to the __zipper()__ function that produces the animation as well as an output panel with some details of the different trajectories. The other panels contain the names of the R packages and output comments. Readers interested in traffic engineering can disregard these panels.
