## cartools: Tools for understanding highway performance.

### Installation
You can install the released version of **cartools** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
``` r
install.packages("cartools")
```
### Recommendation
To obtain the latest updates, use RStudio and download **cartools** from GitHub. Run the following:   

1. install.packages("devtools").

2. devtools::install_github("pjossenbuggen/Basic").

3. _zipper.simulate_(5,5,53.1,5,-700,0.125,0,40,-500,14,1,1.333). 
To see the results, click on Merge.pdf above. A time-location trajectory $t-x$ is shown.

### State of development
At this point in time, **cartools** focuses on freeway bottleneck merging, the lose of a traffic lane from two lanes to one, and the effects of speed volatility on performance. Two merging protocols are analyzed: 1. _Zipper_ 2. _Side-by-side_.
