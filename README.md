The goal of cartools is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of cartools from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cartools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(cartools)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'cartools'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     merge
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
#>            mean         SD
#>u.a        41.18   7.231666
#>u.d        34.96   1.080740
#>k.a        45.40  14.363147
#>k.d        48.00   8.746428
#>q.a      1053.40 121.288087
#>q.d      1797.20 452.147874
#>w          10.02   2.046216
#>tservice    6.40   0.000000
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src  = "/Users/PJO/Desktop/Merge.pdf" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
